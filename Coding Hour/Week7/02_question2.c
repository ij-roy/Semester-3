/*
In a kingdom, there is a line of knights, and each knight has a letter on their armor. Some knights have the same letter, while others have unique ones. The king wants to find the first knight with a unique letterâ€”the one that appears only once in the line.

You are given a string s that represents the order of the knights by their letters. Your task is to help the king find the position of the first knight with a unique letter. If all knights have repeating letters, print -1.

Input Format
A single line containing a string s.
Constraints
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format
You just need print its index. If it does not exist, print -1.

Sample Input 0
aabbccdde
Sample Output 0
8
