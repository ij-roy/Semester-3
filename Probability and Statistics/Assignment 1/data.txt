    Using the Data to Create Visualizations

Box Plot:
    Data: Mismanaged plastic waste percentages across different regions.
    Purpose: Visualize the distribution and variability in plastic waste management.

Scatter Plot:
    Data: Relationship between annual plastic waste generation and mismanaged waste percentage.
    Purpose: Show the correlation between the amount of plastic waste generated and the proportion that is mismanaged.

Frequency Polygon:
    Data: Distribution of plastic debris density across different ocean regions.
    Purpose: Illustrate the spread and frequency of plastic debris in various parts of the ocean.

Bar Graph:
    Data: Annual plastic waste generation by region.
    Purpose: Compare the amounts of plastic waste generated in different regions of the world.

Pie Chart:
    Data: Sources of oceanic plastic pollution.
    Purpose: Show the proportional contribution of various sources to overall plastic pollution in the oceans.
