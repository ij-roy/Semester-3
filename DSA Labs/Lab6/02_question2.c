/*
Question 2. Write a program to check if a given string has balanced bracket 
expression using a stack. Test your program for:  
    a. ()) 
    b. {}([]) 
Optional: Remove the main method from Q1 and include it as  #include “filename.c” in 
this file. You will be able to directly use the push, pop, top functions in this new 
file. You don’t have to code it again.
