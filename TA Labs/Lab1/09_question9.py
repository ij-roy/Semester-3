'''
Question 9. Using the temperature conversion formula, calculate the value at which 
the Celsius and corresponding Fahrenheit values are the same.  
Hint: Take x as unknown and solve for x.
'''

# x = (9/5) * x + 32
# x - (9/5) * x = 32
# (-4/5) * x = 32
# x = 32 / (-4/5) = -40

x = 32 * (-5 / 4)

print(f"The temperature at which Celsius and Fahrenheit values are the same is {x}Â°")
