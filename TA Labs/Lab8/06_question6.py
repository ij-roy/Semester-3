Repeatedly take input from the user in the range of 1 â€“ 10 till the time they enter -1. 
It then displays the histogram shown as follows. Note that the percentage values are 
displayed till 2 decimal places: 
       1 - 2: # # # # # # # # # # 52.00 % 
       3 - 4: # # # # # # 28.00 % 
       5 - 6: # 4.00 % 
       7 - 8: 0.00 % 
       9 - 10: # # # 16 %
